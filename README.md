# PIANO GAME?

I'm TAing the Music and Gameplay class, and recently I taught a class of music theory.
And now music theory can't get out of my head. I need to make it into a game. (is it a game??)
Anyway, just listen to the clip, press the piano keys, and submit to pass each level.

Aand, if music theory is like rocket science to you, the answer for the respective levels are C, Cmaj3, Cmaj, Cmaj7. I tried having player using piano keyboard as answer input, but Unity UI is so hard to use.

I'm not particularly happy with the piano keyboard sprites I made because they ignore enharmonic equivalents and just use sharp notes to represent flat notes but I'm too tired and lazy to remake them :)

I used:
1. ASCII Level Loader;
2. Properties;
3. Singleton;
4. Arrays and for loops;
5. more to be added.
