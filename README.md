# PIANO GAME?

I'm TAing the Music and Gameplay class, and recently I taught a class of music theory.
And now music theory can't get out of my head. I need to make it into a game. (is it a game??)
Anyway, just listen to the clip, press the piano keys, and submit to pass each level.

I'm not particularly happy with the piano keyboard sprites I made because they ignore enharmonic equivalents and just use sharp notes to represent flat notes but I'm too tired and lazy to remake them :)

I used:
1- ASCII Level Loader,
2- Properties,
3- Singleton,
4- Arrays and for loops,
5- more to be added.
